# GooglePlayDownloader

GooglePlayDownloader is a graphical software to download APKs from the Google Play store.

I ever wanted to get applications from the Google Play store but didn't like my android AOSP system being tainted by Google root services neither being filed in the Google account database.

# License
The software is based on :
- googleplay-api to interact with Google PlayStore (https://github.com/egirault/googleplay-api/) BSD license
- androguard to read info info from local APKs on disk (http://code.google.com/p/androguard/) LGPL license
- dummydroid to generate Google Framework Service keys ( https://github.com/onyxbits/dummydroid )
These libs are packaged in the src/ext_libs folder for user convenience but are not part of this project.

The GUI (googleplaydownloader.py) is under AGPL licence (copyright Tuxicoman)
